# California Wildfires Analysis (2013 - 2019)

## Overview
Wildfires have become an increasingly critical issue in California, causing significant environmental, economic, and social impacts. Understanding wildfire patterns through data analytics allows us to gain insights into their frequency, severity, and impact over time.

In this project, we analyze key aspects of California Wildfires, including:
  - Total acres burned per year
  - Top counties with acres burned
  - Total acres burned by season
  - Total fires by season
  - Duration of the fires
  - Resources used to put out the fires
  - Total wildfire area per year
    
By leveraging data-driven insights, we aim to enhance our understanding of wildfire behavior and inform better prevention and response strategies.

## Data and Technologies Used
  - Databes: MongoDB
  - Data Processing: Pandas, PyMongo, NumPy
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Leaflet.js
  - User Interactions:
    - Python: Jupyter Notebook
    - JavaScript: Leaflet.js

## Methodology
We used Python and Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and visualization. The dataset was stored and queried using MongoDB, and data was read using Pandas      DataFrames. Key libraries used include:
  - pymongo for database interactions
  - pandas for data manipulation
  - pprint for structured data output
  - numpy for numerical operations
  - matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

## Key Findings
### Total Acres Burned per Year
  - 2018 had the highest total acres burned: 3.36 million acres
  - 2014 had the lowest total acres burned: 0.45 million acres

### Top Counties with Acres Burned
  - Lake County recorded the highest number of acres burned: 582,764 acres

### Total Fires by Season
  - Summer 2018 had the highest number of wildfires: 200 fires

## Visualization
We integrated interactive maps using Leaflet.js to provide a dynamic user experience for exploring wildfire locations and impacts over time
